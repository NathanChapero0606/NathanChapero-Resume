        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketing Manager</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nathan Chapero, and I am an aspiring marketing manager. I have worked with various leading companies such as Amazon, Apple, and, most recently, Google in employing various marketing techniques in order to establish increased sales within our target demographics. I have accumulated over 50 years of experience through and obtained my marketing business administration degree at the University of California Riverside. I am currently searching for my next business oportunity and have therefore created this website in order to fully demonstrate my capabilities in this field. Dog cat mouse car test schools I am not going to waste my time writing 500 words of carefully constructed sentences..<br><br>

         I want to finish this lab as fast as possible while, of course, achieving the goals that I have been told to achieve by the CS8 website. Anyways, if you're reading this then you are either my professor or my TA, in which case it is an honor to meet you.<br><br>

      However, considering that this course has over 300 students in this lecture, I do not expect anybody to ever read this "essay." It's amazing to think, personally, that nobody will ever read the words on this page. I've always wondered how many parts of our history we have missed out on simply due to the fact that recordings, photos, and other forms of scripture were not available at the time. For example, what exactly happened 500 years ago. It is difficult to piece together all of human history, and as the years fly by, it will only continue to be more difficult. Anyways, how many words am I at right now? I'd guess around 250 words but I will check using my google docs real quick, be right back. Alright, I am at 290 words so I've got a bit more ranting to do sadly. So, uh, what should I talk about? Honestly, if all of this wording had to actually be related to my work experience and life experience in general, there's no way I'd actually be able to write 500 damn word related to that. Hell, I'm writing absolutely nothing right now and it's still a tedious task. Nice to meet you, I'm 18 years old and my hobbies include soccer, video games, and listening to music. It's very basic, I know, but I guess it's popular because it is fun. It's crazy to think that Febuary 2022 is almost over already. Hell, this quarter is almost over already. I will be approaching week 8 and I honestly don't know what the hell I just learned. I mean, sure, I've learned some things but I have no practical use for any of this. For example, I'm in a geology class regarding the Earth's crust and interior, and I could not care less about what I am learning. It's actually interesting, yes, but whenever I realize that I will never need any of this knowledge ever again after this class, it sort of makes it a bitttt more difficult to pay attention and take the midterms seriously. Also, if you don't want to curve this class I totally understand. This isn't like that geology class, where the average on the first midterm was a whopping 52%. Lol, and I got slightly above that at least Well, I've reached my 500 word limit, so I'll keep continuing on this lab. Who knows, maybe I just wrote 600 words for no reason
